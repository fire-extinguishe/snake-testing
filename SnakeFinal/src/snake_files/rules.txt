<p style="text-align: center;"><b>*** RULES ***</b>

'Snake' is a simple game in which you control a snake which strives to
eat as many cherries as possible.
Cherries will appear randomly as soon as the previous ones are eaten.
Witch every eaten cherry, the snake gets longer and longer. 
One cherry equals one additional segment of the snake.
The game ends as soon as the snake touches the boarders of the screen or eats itself.
To turn left or right use "A"/"D" letters on your keyboard.
To go up or down use letters "W" and "S". </p>
